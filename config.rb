# This is the Compass configuration file for scss and sass file processing.
# Compass Configuration Reference: 
#   http://compass-style.org/docs/tutorials/configuration-reference/
#
# The compass utility looks for the configuration file in the following
# locations:
#   - config/compass.rb 
#   - .compass/config.rb 
#   - config/compass.config 
#   - config.rb 
#   - src/config.rb
# If this file is renamed or moved it must match one of the supported 
# paths above or the compass command won't find it unless the --config 
# option is specified.

#require 'bundler/setup'

# Load Compass plugins
#require 'bootstrap-sass'
#require 'bourbon'
#require 'susy'
#require 'zurb-foundation'
